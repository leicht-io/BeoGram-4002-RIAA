# RIAA Schematics for Beogram 4002

This repository contains a KiCad project for an open-source RIAA equalization circuit to be used in the Beogram 4002 turntable.

The project is, for now, a prototype in progress since I need to gain knowledge about audio circuits and operational amplifiers while developing it.

The RIAA is based on a two-stage RIAA using the [LM833](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm833.pdf?ts=1713462514880) which should greatly improve the performance over a singleamplifier design.
