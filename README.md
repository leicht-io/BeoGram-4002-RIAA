# RIAA Schematics for BeoGram 4002

This repository hosts a KiCad project for an open-source RIAA equalization circuit designed for use with the BeoGram 4002 turntable.

Currently, the project is a work in progress, serving as a prototype while I expand my understanding of audio circuits and operational amplifiers during development.

The design features a dual-stage RIAA equalization circuit based on the LM833 but with the OPA2134.
